## Projects

I have been actively involved in various projects that showcase my strong problem-solving skills and technical proficiency. Through these projects, I have demonstrated my ability to design innovative solutions and deliver impactful outcomes.

- **Face‐Mask Detection system** *(Sep 2020 - Nov 2020)*<br>
  - Developed an AI-powered facemask detection system using YOLO pretrained model and MobileNetV2 to accurately detect whether or not people are wearing facemasks using video from surveillance camera. Leveraged Flask (1.1.2) framework for developing a face mask detection application and deployed it on GCP's Compute Engine.

- **Mood based classification of Hindi songs using lyrics** *(Feb 2020 - Apr 2020)*<br>
  - Classified Hindi songs into three different categories, including romantic, sad, and party songs, using Random Forest Classification. Pre-processed data in order to increase accuracy with the use of tokenization, extraction of stop words and stemming.

- **Estimating the effect of climate change on sea level using ML** *(Jan 2020 - Mar 2020)*<br>
  - Developed a comprehensive sea level rise prediction model for both local (San Francisco) and global areas using advanced data analytics techniques. Employed three distinct regression algorithms—Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Neural Network—implemented through MATLAB.

- **Internet Radio - Multicasting multimedia over IP** *(Sep 2019 - Nov 2019)*<br>
  - Implemented IP Multicast through C programming, incorporating socket programming and multi-threading. Developed an Internet Radio system featuring multiple stations and a client-based GUI for Play, Pause, Stop, and Record functionalities.

- **Linear Discriminant Analysis of 32\*32 Grayscale Image on FPGA** *(Sept 2018 - Dec 2018)*<br>
  - Designed an LDA algorithm for grayscale images using MATLAB programming. Translated the MATLAB code into Verilog within Xilinx ISE, enabling the integration of software and hardware. Deployed the Verilog code onto an FPGA for hardware-based execution of LDA.
