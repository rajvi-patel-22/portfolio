# About

Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University, I'm a dedicated CS graduate student driven by continuous skill exploration.

Experienced in software development and problem-solving, I quickly adapt to new tech. Proficient in Java, Python, OOP, Data Structures, and Algorithms, I emphasize clean code through best practices.

Beyond studies, I have demonstrated exceptional contribution to Elasticsearch open source development, ranking among the top 10.

As a former Senior Software Engineer at [Crest Data Systems Pvt. Ltd.](http://crestdatasys.com), I successfully delivered software solutions meeting clients' needs, honing my collaborative and independent problem-solving skills. I also mentored interns in Elasticsearch, guiding their professional development.

Eager for growth, I'm actively seeking Software Development Engineer (SDE) internship/co-op roles for Spring 2025. If you know any relevant positions or wish to connect, please [reach out](mailto:rpate188@asu.edu).

Feel free to browse my resume [here](/cv) or download the PDF [here](http://rajvi-patel.github.io/resume/){:target="_blank"}. And hey, if you're up for it, let's catch up over coffee â€“ my treat!

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).
